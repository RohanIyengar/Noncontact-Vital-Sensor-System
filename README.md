# Noncontact-Vital-Sensor-System

This project was a senior design project for Spring 2017 at Georgia Tech.
The project used a microcontroller unit (MCU), laptop computer (PC), and existing hardware setup to read in a signal respresenting a user's vitals signs data through radar and microwave signals, then generate relevant analysis of heartbeat, respiration rate, and other vitals sign data through a UI. 
All code is provided in this UI. MCU code is usable through Silicon Labs IDE.
