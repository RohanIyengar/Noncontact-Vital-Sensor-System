# Noncontact-Vital-Sensor-System

This project was a senior design project for Spring 2017 at Georgia Tech.
The project used a microcontroller unit (MCU), laptop computer (PC), and existing hardware setup to read in a signal respresenting a user's vitals signs data through radar and microwave signals, then generate relevant analysis of heartbeat, respiration rate, and other vitals sign data through signal analysis. The system uses a UI to control when data collection begins, how long data data is measured for, and transition from raw signal data to processed signals resulting from signal analysis.

All code is provided in this UI. MCU code is usable through Silicon Labs IDE.
